## 🚀 Featured Projects
*You're welcome to click and explore the different projects below!*  

### 🔹 [PPLTX - Daily KPIs ETL & Monitoring](https://github.com/maornezer12/ppltx-tutorial)  
*Data Engineering Pipeline | Python, BigQuery, GCP*  

This project is a complete data engineering training pipeline.
It demonstrates how to create and monitor daily KPI processes on GCP, simulating a production-grade environment.
- **ETL Layer:** Extracts, transforms, and loads daily KPIs (installs, DAU, activity) into BigQuery datasets.  
- **Monitoring Layer:** Detects anomalies and integrity issues in KPI data.  
- **Logs Monitoring:** Tracks ETL job health and execution consistency.  
- **Automation:** Daily job scheduling via `crontab` and detailed logging into BigQuery.
